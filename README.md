# COMP_Network-SEQ-ACK-Game

- This project is about making a computer network program using Python.

- Focused on a special kind of network communication called UDP, which is fast, but not always reliable but we implemented some additional features on top of it.

- Pogram is designed to make this communication in a more game-like fashion.

- Project is called the "SEQ-ACK Game".

## Tools and Materials

The software language in which the project was prepared is Python.

used many Python Libraries in the project, for example: **Python Socket Library , Python Time Library and Python Random Library**.

**The IDE** we used while developing the project was **Visual Studio Code**.

## SEQ-ACK Game

- The game makes sure messages get from the client to the server and back again with the knowledge of getting lost or mixed up, which can happen in ***UDP*** communication.

- Built our program in three main parts: a client module (client.py), a server module (server.py), and the main application module (main.py).

- The **client** module is where users send their messages to the server. 

- The **server** module takes these requests, works on them, and then sends back the messages.

- The **utomatic mode**, also called the auto mode, and the manual mode for the usersâ€™ taste.
